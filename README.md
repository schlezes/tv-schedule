This was an attempt to define a very simple TV schedule; however, the task was more complicated than I expected.

Howver,

The secondary, most important part of this attempt was the discovery of how to scroll either right or left on a 24-hour day, using the am and pm 12-hour intervals.

Here is the algorithm that I finally came up with.

the main purpose of posting this sample website is to remind me to think about how it can be improved; plus, I believe that there is some value to the JavaScript code that can be useful in some other projects, such as in a calendar whereby the algorithm can scroll the day plus or minus, the difference being an array of 30 days for the month or 365 days for the year.
